                The main character is an incompetent and cynical Wizard named Rincewind. He involuntarily
                becomes a guide to the naive tourist, Twoflower. Forced to flee the city of Ankh-Morpork to
                escape a terrible fire (, they begin on a journey across the Disc. Unbeknownst to them,
                their journey is controlled by the Gods playing a board game.
            </p>
            <p>
                They visit the temple of Bel-Shamharoth, where they meet the Hero, Hrun and then head towards
                the Wyrmberg, an upside-down mountain which is home to dragons that only exist in the
                imagination. After escaping (leaving Hrun behind), Rincewind and Twoflower nearly go over the
                waterfall on the edge of the Disc, only to be rescued by Tethis the Sea Troll, and are takin
                to the country of Krull, a city perched on the very edge of the Discworld by a hydrophobic
                wizard. The Krullians wish to discover the gender of Great A'Tuin, the giant turtle which
                carries the Discworld through space, so they have built a space capsule to launch over the
                edge. They intend on sacrificing Rincewind and Twoflower to get Fate to smile on the voyage.
                Instead, Rincewind and Twoflower hijack the capsule in an attempt to escape and are launched
                off the Disc themselves.

                Great A'tuin is the star turtle (genus Chelys Galactica) that carries the Discworld through
                space. 10,000 miles long and nearly as big as the disc itself, not much is known about A'tuin,
                even it's sex remains a mystery. A mystery that the astronomers of Krull were determined to
                solve, unfortunately their space ship - The Potent Voyager - was misappropriated by Rincewind
                and Twoflower. (See the end of The Colour of Magic).

                The Discworld is supported atop A'tuin's back by the four great elephants Berilia, Tubul,
                Great T'Phon and Jerakeen, and the whole assemblage is circled by the small discworld sun and
                moon.<br>
